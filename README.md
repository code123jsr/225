# CRIME DATA PROBABILISTIC ANALYSIS IN LA

This project analyzes crime data in Los Angeles using statistical techniques including Markov inequality, Chebyshev inequality, and Bayes' theorem. The goal is to derive insights and make inferences about crime patterns and trends in LA.

# Analysis

<p align="justify">
The project explores various probability techniques and their applications in analyzing crime data for Los Angeles. It begins with data preprocessing steps, including cleaning and formatting the dataset
to ensure consistency and reliability. The notebook then delves into the application of statistical concepts such as Markov and Chebyshev inequalities to understand the distribution and likelihood of 
crime occurrences across different areas and time periods. Additionally, Bayes' theorem is implemented to compute conditional probabilities, providing insights into the likelihood of specific crime 
types given certain conditions and factors. Visualizations using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn are employed to illustrate the findings, including probability distributions and trend 
analyses. Overall, this aims to uncover meaningful patterns and support informed decision-making processes.  </p>
